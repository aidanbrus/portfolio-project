3rd Journal:

9/25: As you can see from the name of this, this version is version 3 of this project. I went from super vanilla js, like nothing but barebones js to vite environment for three.js and now to react. Feels bad as I was making good progress with the project but I think switching into React will save me in the long run. I suppose this is more of a "YouDontNeedtoReadMe" but journal that's okay. Probably won't give another update till I everything back to where I was before the switch.
