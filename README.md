3rd Journal:

9/25: As you can see from the name of this, this version is version 3 of this project. I went from super vanilla js, like nothing but barebones js to vite environment for three.js and now to react. Feels bad as I was making good progress with the project but I think switching into React will save me in the long run. I suppose this is more of a "YouDontNeedtoReadMe" but journal that's okay. Probably won't give another update till I everything back to where I was before the switch.

10/15: I was planning on doing this more often but I forget. The conversion to react was initally "good" until I realised I actually had a llot of problems. So after more time then I thought it would, I think I have finally ironed out the issues. Still don't regret changing to react, I probably should've switched earlier. That's okay though. Finally getting to the actual content of the page and that animation. Need to get camera around the track and the info panels in. If I can do that, I think that will be most of the heavy lifting done on the wbesite. Certain page will be from a birdseye view, so that I can use paragraphs but that shouldn't be too hard. Panel animation I think will end up being a tough one but we will see.
